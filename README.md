### **Two ways to sort.**
 -  **Automatic - by *name* or *date***<br/>
 - **Manual - with preview for *pictures* and *.txt* files**
   <br/>

   ##
   <br/>
   
First, you must select which way to sort, Automatic or Manual. <br/>
And also select the "origin" folder that contains the files you want to sort. <br/>
Only works on files, ignores folders.<br/>

### **Automatic:**<br/>
   Select the "destination" folder. In this folder the program wil create sub-folders based on options you choose, and <ins>copy</ins> the files there.<br/>
   <sub>NOTE: the **Automatic** option can only copy files.</sub> <br/>
   <br/>
   **Alphabetic:**<br/>
        Sorts the files by name.<br/>
	    Should work for all scripts supported by Windows.<br/>
        The ``` A, B, C ``` and ``` a, b, c ``` options are to use upper-case or lower-case when creating the sorted folders.<br/>
		``` Characters used: ``` is the number of characters/symbols used to create the folder names.<br/>

  <br/>
  
  **Date:**<br/>
    Sorts the files by date. <br/>
	The ```Year``` ```Month``` ```Day``` options are for what part of the date sorted sub-folders will be based on.<br/>
 	They are always created in the order of \YYYY\mm\dd\ <br/>
   	```Created``` ```Modified``` ```Accesed``` are for which date type will be used from the file.<br/>
<br/>

### **Manual:**<br/>
   The ```Add``` button let's you add a folder to the list of possible destinations.<br/>
   Or you can *drag and drop* folders into the list box to add them.<br/>
   Tick the checkbox to select the destination to send. Can copy to multiple folders at once.<br/>
   The ```X``` button on the right of each destination folder is to remove it form the list.<br/>
   The picture preview scales with the window size. Resize from the bottom right corner.<br/>
